###Abstract
StaRS FInE is a critically important team because we deal with one of the last steps in the whole process (filtration). The current outtake pipes are problematic because not only do they clog, currently the method of cleaning them is by dumping buckets of acid into the filters. The remedy for this involves designing and implementing a “pine tree” design that uses the same gravity exclusion principles tested by Horizontal Filtration. We need to fabricate and design this new pipe and experiment to find its failure velocity, but we are confident that we are headed in the right direction.

###Introduction
The StaRS FInE team was disbanded after the fall of 2015, but it has been brought back because of the importance and continued relevance of our task. The current design for the outlet pipes in our StaRS filters can, and needs to be, significantly improved. The small slots get clogged with chemical deposits, and the most effective way to clean them is by dumping buckets of acid into the filters. Not only is the purchasing of these chemicals an extra expense, it is is also inconvenient because the filter has to be closed off while this process happens. Our team’s job is to design and test (to find a failure velocity) a new outlet pipe that does not get clogged by chemical deposits (or takes a very long time). Past teams failed because of issues with sand getting into their outlet pipe design during filtration. Encouragingly, they did develop designs that worked during backwash, the filtration velocity was just too great and exiting water took sand with it. We need to find the failure velocity for past teams’ most encouraging designs and make designs that are better at faster filtration velocities. Because we are looking at the outtake from filtration, which is the very last step of the entire treatment process, we have to be very conscious of head loss and the major and minor losses coming from the pipe we use and the geometry of the shape we design, respectively.


###Literature Review
While there are many papers and explanations of water filtration, it seems that people have yet to explore gravity exclusion principles as part of their process (aside from AguaClara). When
searching for such research, topics simply related to general gravity filtration are returned. In addition, information regarding treating water for fish is popular as well. Traditional treatment involves treating drinking water with chemicals, and filtering with mediums such as mesh or cloth. Our team has determined that these would not be suitable for an AguaClara plant as the same build up found from the current slit method would present itself with the mesh or cloth. In addition, those materials would require replacement more regularly. In some systems, anthracite is used to create larger particles for the water to encounter before reaching the sand phase. Perhaps this is something our group could explore in the gravity exclusion zone in some capacity. Moving bed filters seem to be popular in aqua-ponics and pose the benefit of not requiring backwash. The filter media is able to catch catch bacteria and continuously move. That being said, the system is more complex and expensive to run. Because it seems that outside of our organization, these principles have not been tested, our group must rely primarily on building on our own knowledge and being creative.
###Previous Work
#####StaRS FInE Spring 2015
In the Spring of 2015, the StaRS FInE sub-team dedicated themselves to finding more efficient ways to run the inlet and outlet pipes in the EStaRS filters. They came to the conclusion that a winged design for an outlet pipe is feasible, and that the inlet pipe required further optimization but should follow a different design path than the outlet pipes. They proposed a non-winged inlet pipe that was simply uniformly holed for the even distribution of flow through the filter for fluidization of the sand bed. They made progress in creating and fabricating the way that we test StaRS FInE.

#####StaRS FInE Fall 2015
In the Fall of 2015, the StaRS FInE team would be the last sub-team, until now, dedicated to using the combination of horizontal filtration and StaRS Filter theory methods to research more efficient injection and extraction of water to and from the StaRS filters in the plants. They had plans to optimize the triangular horizontal filter outlet pipe design for practical use in plants, further implement an inlet method, and face the challenges that had to do with the fallbacks of gravity exclusion and head-loss. Although they ultimately designed a winged-inlet pipe that optimized fluidization of the filter sand bed during filtration and backwash, the team was rather pessimistic about the potential for a winged outlet pipe after continual failure (sand in the effluent). They left a number of tasks uncompleted in hopes that the creativity of later StaRS FInE sub-teams could combat the issue from a new direction.

#####StaRS Filter Theory Spring 2018
To understand the injection and extraction methods, it is important to also understand the methodology behind StaRS Filtration in general. Essentially, we use this filter because it is efficient in its ability to filter and backwash at the same rate. It is gravity driven and is “proven to consistently lower the effluent to below the US EPA standard of 0.3 NTU” (StaRS Filter Theory Wiki., 2018). Currently, the StaRS Filter theory team is aiming to test more about the efficiency of different sized sand particles, something we may want to keep updated on during calculations and testing.

#####Horizontal Filtration Spring 2018
From the research of the Horizontal filtration team, we learn most about plate settlers and the team’s experience to combine the methods with those of the StaRS Filters. The design that they hoped to optimize included a vertical backwash flow and horizontal filtration method. This could be useful in understanding how the bed of sand is successfully and completely fluidized so that the filter is still functional. In our intention of future work, we noted exploring more about the failure flow rate for the “sand plugs” created during gravity exclusion. The report notes a relationship discovered between slight dissociation of sand particles from the exclusion zone boundaries and a high flow rate (O'Conner, C., Chao, C., & Galantino, C. ,2018, pp. 4).
