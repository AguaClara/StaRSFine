###Abstract
StaRS FInE is a critically important team because we deal with one of the last steps in the AguaClara process (filtration). The current outtake pipes are problematic because not only do they clog, the current method of cleaning them is by dumping buckets of acid into the filters. Our suggested remedy to combat this problem involves designing and implementing a “pine tree” design that uses the same gravity exclusion principles tested by Horizontal Filtration. We need to fabricate and design this new pipe and experiment to find its failure velocity, but we are confident that we are headed in the right direction.

###Introduction
The StaRS FInE team was disbanded after the fall of 2015, but it has been brought back because of the importance and continued relevance of our task. The current design for the outlet pipes in our StaRS filters can, and needs to be, significantly improved. The small slots get clogged with chemical deposits, and the most effective way to clean them is by dumping buckets of acid into the filters. Not only is the purchasing of these chemicals an extra expense, it is is also inconvenient because the filter has to be closed off while this process happens. Our team’s job is to design and test (to find a failure velocity associated with the gravity exlusion method in sand filters) a new outlet pipe that does not get clogged by chemical deposits (or takes a very long time). Past teams failed because of issues with sand getting into their outlet pipe design during filtration. Encouragingly, they did develop designs that worked during backwash, the filtration velocity was just too great and the water effluent contained a great amount of sand. We need to find the failure velocity for past teams’ most encouraging designs and make designs that are better at faster filtration flow rates. Because we are looking at the outtake from filtration, which is the very last step of the entire treatment process, we have to be very conscious of head loss and the major and minor losses coming from the pipe we use and the geometry of the shape we design, respectively.

###Literature Review
While there are many papers and explanations of water filtration, it seems that people have yet to explore gravity exclusion principles as part of their process (aside from AguaClara). When searching for such research, topics simply related to general gravity filtration are returned. In addition, information regarding treating water for fish is popular as well. Traditional treatment involves treating drinking water with chemicals, and filtering with mediums such as mesh or cloth. Our team has determined that these would not be suitable for an AguaClara plant as the same build up found from the current slit method would present itself with the mesh or cloth. In addition, those materials would require replacement more regularly. In some systems, anthracite is used to create larger particles for the water to encounter before reaching the sand phase. Perhaps this is something our group could explore in the gravity exclusion zone in some capacity. Moving bed filters seem to be popular in aqua-ponics and pose the benefit of not requiring backwash. The filter media is able to catch catch bacteria and continuously move. That being said, the system is more complex and expensive to run. Because it seems that outside of our organization, these principles have not been tested, our group must rely primarily on building on our own knowledge and being creative.

###Previous Work
#####StaRS FInE Spring 2015
In the Spring of 2015, the StaRS FInE sub-team dedicated themselves to finding more efficient ways to run the inlet and outlet pipes in the EStaRS filters. They came to the conclusion that a winged design for an outlet pipe is feasible, and that the inlet pipe required further optimization but should follow a different design structure than the outlet pipes. They proposed a non-winged inlet pipe that was simply uniformly holed for the even distribution of flow through the filter for fluidization of the sand bed. They made progress in creating and fabricating the way that we test StaRS FInE.

#####StaRS FInE Fall 2015
In the Fall of 2015, the StaRS FInE team would be the last sub-team, until now, dedicated to using the combination of horizontal filtration and StaRS Filter theory methods to research more efficient injection and extraction of water to and from the StaRS filters in the plants. They had plans to optimize the triangular horizontal filter outlet pipe design for practical use in plants, further implement an inlet method, and face the challenges that had to do with the fallbacks of gravity exclusion and head-loss. Although they ultimately designed a winged-inlet pipe that optimized fluidization of the filter sand bed during filtration and backwash, the team was rather pessimistic about the potential for a winged outlet pipe after continual failure (sand in the effluent). They left a number of tasks uncompleted in hopes that the creativity of later StaRS FInE sub-teams could combat the issue from a new direction.

#####StaRS Filter Theory Spring 2018
To understand the injection and extraction methods, it is important to also understand the methodology behind StaRS Filtration in general. Essentially, we use this filter because it is efficient in its ability to filter and backwash at the same rate. It is gravity driven and is “proven to consistently lower the effluent to below the US EPA standard of 0.3 NTU” (StaRS Filter Theory Wiki., 2018). Currently, the StaRS Filter theory team is aiming to test more about the efficiency of different sized sand particles, something we may want to keep updated on during calculations and testing.

#####Horizontal Filtration Spring 2018
From the research of the Horizontal filtration team, we learn most about plate settlers and the team’s experience to combine the methods with those of the StaRS Filters. The design that they hoped to optimize included a vertical backwash flow and horizontal filtration method. This could be useful in understanding how the bed of sand is successfully and completely fluidized so that the filter is still functional. In our intention of future work, we noted exploring more about the failure flow rate for the “sand plugs” created during gravity exclusion. The report notes a relationship discovered between slight dissociation of sand particles from the exclusion zone boundaries and a high flow rate (O'Conner, C., Chao, C., & Galantino, C. ,2018, pp. 4).

### Introduction
The StaRS FInE team was disbanded after the fall of 2015, but it has been brought back because of the importance and continued relevance of our [**the team's**] task. The current design for the outlet pipes in our [**omit**] StaRS filters can, and needs to be, significantly improved. The small slots get clogged with chemical deposits, and the most effective way to clean them is by dumping buckets of acid into the filters. Not only is the purchasing of these chemicals an extra expense, it is is [**double word**] also inconvenient because the filter has to be closed off while this process happens [**could be rephrases as "plant flow has to be diverted when this process happens**"]. Our [**The**] team’s job is to design and test (to find a failure velocity associated with the gravity exlusion [**spelling**] method in sand filters) a new outlet pipe that does not get clogged by chemical deposits (or takes a very long time). [**Separate this into two sentences, possibly: "The team's goal is to develop and a test an outlet system that does not clog with chemical deposits and prevents sand escape. This involves characterizing the failure velocity of sand exclusion zones and determining failure time"**] Past teams failed because of issues with sand getting into their outlet pipe design during filtration. Encouragingly, they did develop designs that worked during backwash, the filtration velocity was just too great and the water effluent contained a great amount of sand. We [**the team**] need to find the failure velocity for past teams’ most encouraging designs and make designs that are better at faster filtration flow rates [**rephrase this sentence for clarity**]. Because we are looking at the outtake from filtration [**Because this problem occurs at the filtration outtake**], which is the very last step of the entire [**omit for brevity**] treatment process, we[**the team**] have to be very conscious of head loss and the major and minor losses coming from the pipe we use and the geometry of the shape we design, respectively [**...coming from the outlet pipe and the design geometry**]


[**You can give more background on what the chemical is that is getting deposited on the pipes is and how it gets there. Though this isn't central to the team's motivation its an important fact to consider when looking at alternate designs. Additionally a schematic on fluidization might be helpful to provide an overview of the design or what the exclusion zone is.**]

### Literature Review
While there are many papers and explanations of water filtration [**feel free to specify sand filtration as that is what is relevant here**], it seems that people [**researchers**] have yet to explore gravity exclusion principles as part of their process (aside from AguaClara). When searching for such research, topics simply related to general gravity filtration are returned. In addition, information regarding treating water for fish is popular as well. Traditional treatment involves treating drinking water with chemicals, and filtering with mediums such as mesh or cloth. Our [**The**] team has determined that these would not be suitable for an AguaClara plant as the same build up found from the current slot method would present itself with the mesh or cloth. In addition, those materials would require replacement more regularly. [**Great point!**] In some systems, anthracite is used to create larger particles for the water to encounter before reaching the sand phase. Perhaps this is something our group could explore in the gravity exclusion zone in some capacity. Moving bed filters seem to be popular in aqua-ponics and pose the benefit of not requiring backwash. [**is the is the same as fluidized bed?**] The filter media is able to catch catch [**double word**] bacteria and continuously move. That being said, the system is more complex and expensive to run. Because it seems that outside of our organization [AguaClara], these principles have not been tested, our [**the**] group must rely primarily on building on our own [**independent**] knowledge and being creative.

The testing system consists of a rectangular structure that can be filled with sand and water, and attached to outlet and inlet pipes to emulate the StaRS Filters used in the plants.

To understand the injection and extraction methods, it is important to also understand the methodology behind StaRS Filtration in general. Essentially, AguaClara uses this filter because it is efficient in its ability to filter and backwash at the same rate. It is gravity driven and is “proven to consistently lower the effluent to below the US EPA standard of 0.3 NTU” (StaRS Filter Theory Wiki., 2018).

### Methods
#### Experimental Apparatus
##### Test 1: Sand Flow Against Surface Minimum Angle
Below is the apparatus of the simple design used to attain more insight of the angle at which sand begins to slide down a flat surface.

This information was attained so there would be more understanding about the function of the “Christmas Tree” design. It was assumed that occasionally the gravity exclusion zones would fail and that sand would escape it’s “plug” and be in a region against the branches of the horizontal filters. To ensure that the sand could fall onto the lower of the plates and be directed back into the sand plug, an essential quality of the system is the ability for sand to be under the under the influence of gravity.

To do so, an apparatus was created that emulated the qualities of the space in between branches inside of the filter. A clear PVC pipe was filled as much as possible with water and a small amount of sand. The ends were sealed with watertight caps, and the sand was distributed along the long surface of the pipe.

<p align="center"> Figure 3 : Minimum angle for sand movement apparatus
</p>

##### Test 2: Christmas Tree in a 4 Inch Pipe Prototype
Testing the feasibility of the design prototype will be done in a 4-inch diameter clear PVC pipe. The design was constructed in OnShape and further edited to fit into a pipe, as shown below.

The apparatus was constructed to scale and will be further fabricated in the future. In the meantime, the 3D printed structure is sanded to fit tightly into the pipe. The wings on the design were structured together by blocks of PVC and secured so the wings could withstand the force from filtrations. In the future, holes will be drilled in the PVC pipe matching the “outlet pipes” on the 3D printed prototype and a structure will be built to secure the filter in the pipe base.

#### Procedure
##### Test 1: Sand Flow Against Surface: Minimum Angle
The pipe filled with sand and water was slowly raised until the sand along the surface of the pipe would fall at a continuous rate. Immediately, the angle was measured and the results were recorded.

### Results and analysis
##### Test 1: Sand Flow Against Surface: Minimum Angle
Ultimately, the three values recorded from the experiment, in degrees are as follows:
Trial 1 | Trial 2 | Trial 3| Average
--- | --- | ---| ---
26.9 | 26.4 | 26.2| 26.5
This demonstrates that the minimum angle at which the tree design wings must be from the horizontal is 26.5 degrees, very reasonable and accounted for in the OnShape design of the prototype.
