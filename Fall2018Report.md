### Abstract
StaRS FInE is a critically important team because the team deals with one of the last steps in the AguaClara process (filtration). The current outtake pipes are problematic because not only do they clog, the current method of cleaning them is with large quantities of acid. StaRS Fine's suggested remedy to combat this problem involves designing and implementing a “Christmas tree” design that uses the same gravity exclusion principles tested by Horizontal Filtration. The key conclusions of this semester were finding the minimum angle necessary for the sand to slide down the branches of the tree design with gravity and designing, parameterizing, and printing a small model of the design and testing it with water flowing through a PVC pipe.

### Introduction
The StaRS FInE team was disbanded after the fall of 2015, but it has been brought back because of the importance and continued relevance of the team's task. The current design for the outlet pipes in StaRS filters can, and needs to be, significantly improved. The small slots get clogged with chemical deposits, and the most effective way to clean them is by pouring buckets of acid into the filters. Not only is the purchasing of these chemicals an extra expense, it is also inconvenient because plant flow must be diverted when this process happens. The team’s goal is to develop and test an outlet system that does not clog with chemical deposits and prevents sand escape. This involves characterizing the failure velocity of sand exclusion zones and determining failure time. Past teams failed because of issues with sand getting into their outlet pipe design during filtration. Encouragingly, they did develop designs that worked during backwash, the filtration velocity was just too great and the water effluent contained a great amount of sand. Because this problem occurs at the filtration outtake, the team must be very conscious of head loss and the major and minor losses coming from the outlet pipe and the design geometry.

The goals for this semester were to design a new outlet pipe that would not clog from chemical deposits, create a testable apparatus to see if this design could handle backwash and filtration. In the future, this apparatus will have to be tested with sand and water to find the failure velocity and what mode of failure must be guarded against, in other words, does the sand move up as a solid plug or do individual grains make their way through the outlet pipe when filtration speed gets too fast? This will be a task for a future team, but the pipe design is very promising so far.


### Literature Review
While there are many papers and explanations of water and sand filtration, it seems that researchers have yet to explore gravity exclusion principles as part of their process (aside from AguaClara). When searching for such research, topics simply related to general gravity filtration are returned. In addition, information regarding treating water for fish is popular as well. Traditional treatment involves treating drinking water with chemicals, and filtering with mediums such as mesh or cloth. The team has determined that these would not be suitable for an AguaClara plant as the same build up found from the current slot method would present itself with the mesh or cloth. In addition, those materials would require replacement more regularly. In some systems, anthracite is used to create larger particles for the water to encounter before reaching the sand phase. Perhaps this is something the group could explore in the gravity exclusion zone in some capacity. Moving bed filters, known to us as fluidized bed filters, seem to be popular in aqua-ponics and pose the benefit of not requiring backwash. The filter media is able to catch bacteria and continuously move. That being said, the system is more complex and expensive to run. Because it seems that outside of AguaClara these principles have not been tested, the group must rely primarily on building on previous independent knowledge and creativity.

### Previous Work
##### StaRS FInE Spring 2015
In the Spring of 2015, the StaRS FInE sub-team dedicated themselves to finding more efficient ways to run the inlet and outlet pipes in the EStaRS filters. They came to the conclusion that a winged design for an outlet pipe is feasible, and that the inlet pipe required further optimization but should follow a different design structure than the outlet pipes. They proposed a non-winged inlet pipe that was simply uniformly holed for the even distribution of flow through the filter for fluidization of the sand bed. They made progress in creating and fabricating the way that StaRS FInE is tested. The testing system consists of a rectangular structure that can be filled with sand and water, and attached to outlet and inlet pipes to emulate the StaRS Filters used in the plants.

##### StaRS FInE Fall 2015
In the Fall of 2015, the StaRS FInE team would be the last sub-team, until now, dedicated to using the combination of horizontal filtration and StaRS Filter theory methods to research more efficient injection and extraction of water to and from the StaRS filters in the plants. They had plans to optimize the triangular horizontal filter outlet pipe design for practical use in plants, further implement an inlet method, and face the challenges that had to do with the fallbacks of gravity exclusion and head-loss. Although they ultimately designed a winged-inlet pipe that optimized fluidization of the filter sand bed during filtration and backwash, the team was rather pessimistic about the potential for a winged outlet pipe after continual failure (sand in the effluent). They left a number of tasks uncompleted in hopes that the creativity of later StaRS FInE sub-teams could combat the issue from a new direction.

##### StaRS Filter Theory Spring 2018
To understand the injection and extraction methods, it is important to also understand the methodology behind StaRS Filtration in general. Essentially, AguaClara use this filter because it is efficient in its ability to filter and backwash at the same rate. It is gravity driven and is “proven to consistently lower the effluent to below the US EPA standard of 0.3 NTU” (StaRS Filter Theory Wiki., 2018). Currently, the StaRS Filter theory team is aiming to test more about the efficiency of different sized sand particles, something the team may want to keep updated on during calculations and testing.

##### Horizontal Filtration Spring 2018
From the research of the Horizontal filtration team, the team learns most about plate settlers and the team’s experience to combine the methods with those of the StaRS Filters. The design that they hoped to optimize included a vertical backwash flow and horizontal filtration method. This schema could be useful in understanding how the bed of sand is successfully and completely fluidized so that the filter is still functional. In the intention of future work, we noted exploring more about the failure flow rate for the “sand plugs” created during gravity exclusion. The report notes a relationship discovered between slight dissociation of sand particles from the exclusion zone boundaries and a high flow rate (O'Connor, C., Chao, C., & Galantino, C. ,2018, pp. 4).

### Methods
#### Experimental Apparatus
##### Test 1: Sand Flow Against Surface Minimum Angle
Below, **Figure 3** shows the apparatus of the simple design used to attain more insight of the angle at which sand begins to slide down a flat surface.

This information was attained so there would be more understanding about the function of the “Christmas Tree” design. It was assumed that occasionally the gravity exclusion zones would fail and that sand would escape it’s “plug” and be in a region against the branches of the horizontal filters. To ensure that the sand could fall onto the lower of the plates and be directed back into the sand plug, an essential quality of the system is the ability for sand to be under the influence of gravity.

To do so, an apparatus was created that emulated the qualities of the space in between branches inside of the filter. A clear PVC pipe was filled with water and a small amount of sand. The ends were sealed with watertight caps, and the sand was distributed along the long surface of the pipe. The results of this experiment are presented below.

##### Test 2: Christmas Tree in a 4 Inch Pipe Model
Testing the feasibility of the design prototype will be done in a 4-inch diameter clear PVC pipe. The design was constructed in OnShape and further edited to fit into a pipe, as shown below.

[**Jonathan: I'm not sure what the right most image actually is.**]
[**Jonathan: I would also suggest that you add an image showing the direction the water flows in this apparatus, as well as saying that the sand will not also flow out.**]

The apparatus was constructed to scale and will be further fabricated in the future. In the meantime, the 3D printed structure was sanded to fit tightly into the pipe. The wings on the design were structured together by blocks of PVC and secured so the wings could withstand the force from filtration.

</p>

The prototype was further fabricated by adding additional structures to support the top and bottom of the 3D Printed filter so it could withstand the force of flowing water from filtration. The simplest method in doing this was cutting a PCV pipe of smaller diameter for a flat surface that will not obstruct the flow of sand or water to and from the filter.

Caps were added to the pipe to ensure watertight quality for testing. **Figure 9** demonstrates the hole drilling for the outlet tubes, which we ultimately inserted 3 small outlets to for extraction from the system. The lower cap included a water tap which was used for inlet flow.

Finally, the system was attached to a peristaltic pump to conduct tests.

</p>

##### Test 3: Peristaltic Pump RPM to mL/second
Another consideration that the team was toying with was the rate at which the filter needed to extract water. This rate is generally in mL/second in AguaClara plants but the peristaltic pump functioned at RPM. This number will be essential to future data collection so the team set up an experiment to measure the precision in equating RPM to mL/second linearly.

To do so, the team filled a precise graduated cylinder with water and inserted a peristaltic outlet pipe.

#### Procedure
##### Test 1: Sand Flow Against Surface: Minimum Angle
The pipe filled with sand and water was slowly raised until the sand along the surface of the pipe would fall at a continuous rate. Immediately, the angle was measured and the results were recorded.

##### Test 2: Christmas Tree in a 4 Inch Pipe Model
After fabricating our model filter system, the first test we conducted was designed to understand the feasibility of the watertight qualities and the injection and extraction of water without sand.

To do so, we attached the inlet to the tap water from the drop down tap and the outlet pipes to a main tube connected to a peristaltic pump. Once the water was nearly above the level of the outlet holes, we began to run the peristaltic pump at a low rate.

We adjusted the rate of the pump until water was flowing in and out at a steady rate. Eventually, we changed the inlet source of water to the sink in the lab so that there were less air bubbles coming from the source.

One consideration during this experiment was the rate at which the team would be taking water out of the apparatus. To emulate the current rate that filters function at, the team settled on the idea that the apparatus could ultimately be treated as life size, with respect to the current filter extraction rates. This extraction rate will be considered more in the future with tests including sand, but the team tested the ability of the apparatus to pull water at a number of rates (in RPM).

##### Test 3: Peristaltic Pump RPM to mL/second
Once the pump's outlet was inserted into the water, the team members set up with a stopwatch and recorded values at which the pump extracted a set volume of water.

The team repeated this experiment with a number of RPM values with multiple trials for each to test consistency and accuracy.

### Results and analysis
##### Test 1: Sand Flow Against Surface: Minimum Angle
Ultimately, the three values recorded from the experiment, in degrees are as follows:

| Trial 1 | Trial 2 | Trial 3 | Average |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 26.92    | 26.43    | 26.27    | 26.64    |

This demonstrates that the minimum angle at which the tree design wings must be from the horizontal is 26.5 degrees, very reasonable and accounted for in the OnShape design of the prototype. In the future, it may be helpful to conduct more trials on angle to ensure greater safety, for if the angle of the wings is too low, sand will not fall from the exclusion zone, which is why the minimum angle is important.

##### Test 2: Christmas Tree in a 4 Inch Pipe Model
Our system was successful in its ability to hold, inject, and extract water. After adjusting the source of water to remove air bubbles, there was still a small about of air flowing through the water in the PVC. This indicates a place where the system was not air tight. The lower cap was leaking water so we glued the perimeter where the PVC meets the cap edge.

Another issue was the difficulty that the team had with keeping the system upright. To combat this, we developed a stand where the tap on the bottom of the PVC cap still had room to rest.

<p align="center"> <b> Figure 12</b>: The data collected from peristaltic pump for two trials of a number of RPM
</p>

Along with this data, the team came to understand the relationship between RPM and extraction rate by graphing the results. Although the data is primarily linear, there is error due to the lack of precision for the team's ability to measure time and read the graduated cylinder exactly. But, in **Figure 13**, the data is fitted to a linear model with the equation as follows.

$$y_{rate}={0.0194 x_{RPM}} + 0.0425$$

</p>

### Conclusions
Based on our tests for the minimum inclination angle for the continuous flow of sand on a PVC surface, the team concluded that an angle of at least 26.64 degrees is an essential design limitation for constructing a triangular shaped horizontal filter.  

Also, after the testing for water in the team's 4-Inch PVC pipe model, the team concluded that the model will be sufficient for water flow. Although the team did not yet have the chance to do sand as well, ensuring the system is watertight and that water could be extracted from it was essential to continuing with research.

Finally, the data from the RPM and rate of extraction correlation gives the team a fairly accurate relationship between the two in the case of the peristaltic pump in the lab, which ultimately aids in the application of the team's research to AguaClara sand filters currently.

### Future Work
In the future, the team hopes to continue testing the existing apparatus for simulation of the StaRS filters. This will include adding sand to the PVC as well as understanding the flow rates of backwash and filtration with respect to the model system. This will give the team an indication of what adjustments must be made to the system to optimize or correct the function. In addition, the team is still awaiting more data from the Horizontal filtration team about research they are conducting on the failure velocity of water with respect to gravity exclusion.


### Manual
Much of the work of the current StaRS Fine team is built off past teams’ successes and failures. The current idea for pipe geometry is informed by the past failures of winged outlet pipes during high filtration speeds, which informed the calculations made to increase the area under our branches.

The increase in area under the branches acts to decrease the velocity of the water flowing through, preventing the sand from fluidizing and exiting. The equation describing flow is Q = V*A where V is velocity and A is area. For a pipe with area A, velocity through V and flow rate Q, the value of Q must be the same for the mass flowing through the tree as through the pipe. Fluidization velocity is 5 mm/s, so the velocity through the tree must be lower than 5. The wing area was determined by Awing = Apipe*Vpipe/5. In that case, Apipe is the cross-sectional area of the 4 inch diameter pipe, and Vpipe is approximately 1 mm/s.

$$A_{wing}=\frac{A_{pipe} * V_{pipe}}{5}$$

[**For equations, it is recommended to used one or two '$'. Also, you may want to take the eqation out of the main text body**]

</p>

The sub-team designed and 3D printed a model of this design that is shaped to be placed in a pipe with a 4 inch diameter so it can be tested at different velocities. The model was designed in Onshape, parameterized based on calculations described above, then 3D printed and sanded at the corners to allow it to perfectly fit into the pipe.
The only data that is purely experimental at this point is the minimum angle for the branch. This was a simple experiment that shows the angle that sand begins to slide down with gravity. Using geometry motivated by gravity means that even if sand does follow water into the branch it should slide down by itself.

</p>

<p align="center"> <b>Figure 15</b>: Fabrication Protractor
</p>

Using a fabrication protractor, the end of the pipe filled with sand and water was moved up slowly until all of the sand started moving down the pipe. This happened at a significant rate at 26.5 degrees, meaning that when there is no flow up through the branch, sand will settle to the bottom at this angle. The design needs to work during backwash and filtration, where the water is flowing quickly upward, so this angle is the smallest one possible. This is a useful constraint because in theory it limits the area we can have under the branches. However, the initial design reaches the necessary area constraints at an angle of 30 degrees, so decreasing the angle past the minimum point is not a concern.

As for more details about the design in Onshape, it was constructed so that the structure could be configured with correct dimensions for later 3D printing. Each designs configurations are shown below.

StaRSFine's first experiment with the 3D printed model was a success. The model was made to fit into a four inch diameter pipe, though some sanding was necessary to make sure it fit snugly. Then, the drill in the machine shop was used to drill holes that lined up exactly with the holes in the back of the model. Small tubes were inserted into these holes and sealed with glue to make a watertight seal. These tubes were then connected to a larger tube that ran through the peristaltic pump and then to the wastewater outtake pipe. Another tube was inserted into the hole in the bottom cap to fill the pipe with water. The purpose of running a test with only water was only to make sure the apparatus was watertight and that there were no air or water leaks that would skew data.

There is still work to be done to test this design. The main concern (and where StaRSFine has failed in the past) is that sand will follow water out of the outlet pipe once higher filtration speeds are approached. Horizontal Filtration is also interested in finding the velocity at which sand follows water out of the outlet pipe, so communication and data sharing between the two teams will be helpful. The velocity found by Horizontal Filtration is necessary to consider when StaRSFine begins to experiment with sand to prevent starting with too large a filtration velocity. The peristaltic pipe is not perfectly calibrated, so it will be necessary to run an experiment with a graduated cylinder full of water and see how many milliliters the pump is actually pulling up each minute. Once the speed that the model fails consistently is found, this can be compared to calculations and see if it is worth making a larger model (to scale with the actual filter) or if a new design must be created. Theoretically, this design has enough area to work for backwash and filtration velocities, and the apparatus will be watertight and set up to handle longer tests, so the next StaRSFine team has a very strong foundation to work with. The goals that were not completed are still worth pursuing in next semesters, especially because the team is so close to finding out if this design would work in future AguaClara plants.
