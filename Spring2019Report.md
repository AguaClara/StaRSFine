## Abstract
Briefly summarize your previous work, goals and objectives, what you have accomplished, and future work. (100 words max)

## Introduction
Explain how the completion of your challenge will affect AguaClara and the mission of providing safe drinking water (or sustainable wastewater treatment!). If this is a continuing team, how will your contribution build upon previous research? What needs to be further discovered or defined? If this is a new team, what prompted the inclusion of this team?

## Literature Review and Previous Work

The work of StaRS FInE has not been investigated outside of AguaClara making the project exciting, and requiring innovation on the part of each team member. In the past the team has found examples related to filters from aqua-ponics and various filtering methods, however the alternate systems are more complicated, and would encounter the same issues that AguaClara filters already face. The StaRS FInE team members are the same this semester as last semester, however last semester the team worked mainly on research, and this semester the project has shifted to fabrication.

Last semester the team encountered a few key insights. First, the team tested at what angle sand falls in a pipe filled with water to determine an optimal angle where sand escaping the gravity exclusion zone is still likely to fall back down. The optimal angle was determined to be 26.64 degrees.  

A christmas tree design was created in onshape and 3D printed to fit inside of a 4-inch tube. Unlike previous teams dating back to 2015, the fall 2018 team ensured that the flow rate, velocity, and wing area of the apparatus all work together to prevent sand from exiting during backwash. This apparatus is still being used this semester as a main tool for research.


## Methods
Explain the techniques you have used to acquire additional data and insights. Reserve fine detail for the Manual at the end of the report, but use this section to give an overview with enough detail for the reader to understand your Results and Analysis. Describe your apparatus, and have a justification for every decision you made and every parameter you chose in the design of the apparatus. Be especially careful to detail the conditions your experiments were conducted under, as this information is especially important for interpreting your results

Below, some example sections are given. Sectioning the report is meant to keep similar information together.  Continue making sections as necessary, or delete sections if you do not need them. Feel free to add subsubsections to further delineate the information. For example, under the Experimental Apparatus section below, the EStaRS team might consider having sections such as "Filter Design" and "Filter Fabrication".

### Experimental Apparatus Design
The apparatus was designed in Onshape last semester, first including a 3D-printed horizontal filter, and then the 4-Inch diameter PVC pipe that will become the prototype for StaRS FInE testing of the gravity exclusion method for extraction. Below are the Onshape part studio, the Onshape drawings, and the photo of the newly fabricated apparatus. After assembling the apparatus, it was designed to have outlet holes in the filter and in the prototype that match tubing size for the outlet flow rate. The tubes are glued to ensure water tight extraction, as shown below.

### Experimental Apparatus Fabrication
The apparatus was fabricated last semester. Upon revisiting the design at the beginning of the semester, Monroe suggested that the team perform calculations to determine if the prototype could withstand flow rates used in the actual plants. Accounting for headless and the flow rate calculated below in the ___ section, the team spent the beginning of this semester planning for and re-fabricating the outlet holes to adjust. The space between the wings in the filter, as show below in figure 4, was minimal. The team used Onshape to determine if increasing the hole size to fit larger diameter outlet tubing was possible. It was determined that the holes were to be offset in order to account for size without disrupting the functionality of the filter.

Explain your apparatus setup using enough detail such that future teams can recreate your apparatus. Make sure to explain why you built it this way. Create a schematic drawing of the apparatus (not a photo) that has clearly labeled components, flow paths, sensors, and reactor geometry.

### Figure requirements
 - Create the graph using python (not Excel)
 - If the x axis is time then make zero time reflect the beginning of the test.
 - Use a white background for all graphs.
 - Most data will have both x and y values and thus should be presented using an xy scatter plot.
 - Label all axes and include units where appropriate.
 - Axis scale labels should be in the margin of the graph and not inside the graph border.
 - Eliminate parts of the range in both x and y axis that aren't used or that aren't meaningful.
 - Place a caption with a brief description below the graph. Add this caption using the wiki formatting, not in your graphing software.
 - Use data symbols to show data points unless there is so much data that the symbols overlap. If the data symbols overlap it is better to connect the data points with a line and not show the data symbols.
 - When presenting multiple plots on a single graph make sure that it is easy to distinguish the plots using the legend.
 - If curve fitting is used explain why and include the equation (elsewhere in the report).
 - If a model or theoretical curve is presented it should be a smooth curve without data points.
 - Use the same font in the graphs as you use in the text of the report.
 - Insert the graph in your report after the first reference to it in the text. Inserted the graph after the next paragraph break
 - Scale the size of the graph so it is large enough to see the data and read the text without having to follow a link to see a larger image. Avoid using hyperlinks on images because that causes the export to Microsoft Word option to not include the image.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions
Explain what you have learned and how that influences your next steps. Why does what you discovered matter to AguaClara?

Make sure that you defend your conclusions with facts and results.

## Future Work
Describe your plan of action for the next several weeks of research. Detail the next steps for this team. How can AguaClara use what you discovered for future projects? Your suggestions for challenges for future teams are most welcome. Should research in this area continue?

# Manual
The goal of this section is to provide all of the guidance that would be necessary for a future team to pick up your work where the team left off.

## Fabrication Details
The current apparatus design was revisited. The team noted the small outlet pipe size, and did the below calculation to determine that minimum pipe diameter was not met.

| Respective Flow Rate      | Minimum Tube Inner Diameter  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|---|---|---|
| 36.67 milliliter / second | 3.762 millimeter      |

Shaving the glue from the previous tubes, the team detached the tubes. Using the new calculated inner diameter, the team found tubing that matched met the minimum standard and considered how it would affect the design of the 3D printed pine-tree filter which was already fit to the prototype PVC tube by holes drilled. In the OnShape drawing, the team determined that, if the filter was taken from the prototype, respective sized holes could be drilled with the drill press. The holes were designed to be offset from the original holes while still remaining in the bounds of the upper and lower wings. Holes were drilled to match these on the 4-Inch PVC prototype.
## Experimental Checklist
Before running the experiments, the team ensured that the prototype was water tight, in order to collect accurate data regarding the flow rates of injection and extraction.
