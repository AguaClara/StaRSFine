## Abstract

StaRS FInE has worked to develop an improved filter technology for AguaClara outlet pipes.[**a bit redundant no? I would just choose either critical or important**] Filtration is the last step in an AguaClara plant[**Aren't all the steps important? Would consider the clause after "because" and go straight into the next sentence**]. As a result, it is the last opportunity to remove particles that have slipped through all previous treatment processes.
Prior to StaRS FInE, the outtake pipes used in vertical filtration were problematic because small slits in the pipes would clog with chemical deposits. In order to clean the filters and wash away the deposits, clean water was emptied from the larger outlets to increase outflow velocity through the slots to dislodge the chemicals. In the process, clean water was wasted. StaRS FInE designed an alternative to the outtake pipes, triangular in shape, and therefore referred to as the “Christmas tree” design. The design relied on larger openings to prevent clogs, as well as the gravity exclusion principle to prevent sand from exiting the outlet pipes. The focus of StaRS FInE in the spring of 2019 was to test the three dimensional model printed in the fall of 2019 with sand to find what velocity leads to failure in the form of sand in the outlets.

## Introduction

The spring of 2019 was StaRS FInE's second semester working on recent improvements since being disbanded in the fall of 2015. The subteam was brought back in the fall of 2018 because of its continued relevance to AguaClara plants. The filter system used then became clogged throughout the day with chemical deposits, [**which chemicals? PaCl?**] mostly from PaCl, but [**but**] there was no sustainable solution to the clogging. Chemical deposits built up on the small slots of the filters, and the plant had to be temporarily shut off periodically for cleaning. During this cleaning (not to be confused with backwash, where the sand particles in the filter are cleaned), clean water would be purged to dislodge the build up on the pipes. Alternatively, buckets of acid could be poured into the filter to clean them, which was also not ideal. In both of these scenarios, the filter could not be used while it was cleaned, and clean water was wasted, whether it was being used to purge the pipe or to divert water from the filters while they were being cleaned with acid. The goal of StaRS FInE was to develop and test an outlet system that prevented sand from escaping and did not clog with chemical deposits. Past teams failed because of issues with sand getting into their outlet pipes during filtration. The past team did develop designs that worked during backwash, however the filtration velocity was too large for the parameters of their design and the water effluent contained a significant amount of sand. Because this problem occurred at the filtration outtake, the team was very conscious of head loss and the major and minor losses coming from the outlet pipe and the design geometry.

The goals for the spring of 2019 were to test the apparatus (designed and 3D printed in the Fall 2018) with sand, discover the failure velocity for this apparatus, and make changes to the spacing of the branches and angles if necessary. The original spacing and angles were based on some of the research of Horizontal Filtration (another AguaClara subteam), the results of testing by past StaRS teams, and the library of AguaClara fluid mechanics calculations. The team also had to discover the possible modes of failure. Failure modes may be caused by flow that is too fast, which may lead to sand moving up as a solid plug or small grains of sand getting into the outlet pipe. Fall 2018's design was promising, but before it was ready to be proposed as a solution, many more tests had to be run.

**[Include and explain gravity exclusion/sand exclusion zones]**
Gravity exclusion is a principle that explains some interaction between sand and water that informs the research and fabrication of StaRS FInE. The idea is that for two flat surfaces (branches) creating a roof with a specific angle, if sand were to get beneath the branch, it would slide down with gravity and remain outside of the outlet. The water beneath the branches creates enough pressure that the sand remains out of the outlet pipe and in the gravity exclusion zone. This zone is formed by the sand that settles beneath the branches. The biggest challenge with preventing sand from going into the outlet happens during forward filtration, when water is moving quickly through the outlet. In this case, the sand-water interface at the edge of the exclusion zone must be large enough that the force of gravity on the sand is greater than the force of the water moving up through the sand.

## Literature Review and Previous Work

The work of StaRS FInE has not been investigated outside of AguaClara, **[,]** making the project exciting, ~~and~~ requiring innovation on the part of each team member. In the past, **[,]** the team has found examples related to filters from aquaponics and various filtering methods. That being said, the alternate systems are more complicated, and would have encountered the same issues that AguaClara filters had already faced. The StaRS FInE team members remained the same from the fall of 2018 to the spring of 2019. That being said, the team focused on research in the fall, whereas the team shifted to fabrication in the spring.

**[What are the other insights?? The last paragraph seems disconnected from the paragraph before it. What happened in the 2015 team?]**

From the reports of the 2015 team, it seems that the necessary wingspan and size of the sand-water interface was not calculated correctly. This is supported by their lack of success with keeping sand from exiting the filter during higher forward filtration velocities. The size of the spring of 2019's model interface is much larger and there has been greater success in keeping sand out of the outlets.

In the fall of 2018 the team discovered **["discovered" may be more fitting]** a few key insights. First, the team tested the **[the]** angle at which **[at which]** sand falls in a pipe filled with water to determine an optimal angle where sand escaping the gravity exclusion zone is still likely to fall back down. The optimal angle was determined to be 26.64 degrees.  

From the calculations done with the AguaClara fluid calculation Python code library, a "Christmas tree" design was created in OnShape and 3D printed to fit inside of a 4-inch tube. Unlike previous teams dating back to 2015, the fall 2018 team ensured that the flow rate, velocity, and wing area of the apparatus all work together to prevent sand from exiting during backwash. This apparatus is still being used this semester as a main tool for research.

## Methods

### Experimental Apparatus Design
#### Trial 1

The apparatus was designed in OnShape last semester, first including a 3D-printed horizontal filter, and then a **[a]** 4-Inch diameter PVC pipe that would **[would]** become the prototype for StaRS FInE testing of the gravity exclusion method for extraction. For more information on this apparatus **[apparatus]**, reference the Fall 2018 Report. Below are the OnShape part studio, the OnShape drawings, and the photo of the newly fabricated apparatus. After assembling the apparatus, it was designed to have outlet holes in the filter and in the prototype that match tubing size for the outlet flow rate.

**[What is gravity exclusion method? This was not explained in the intro]**-*see above*

**[Any way to get these photos bigger? They are pretty but hard to see in the report. ]**

The experiments up to trial 1 had tested the filter's ability to form sand exclusion zones. Monroe suggested that the team simulate real life AguaClara filter conditions as best as possible. Therefore, it was designed so that the inlet, below the filter would simulate filtration. **[What are sand exclusion zones?Explain either in previous work/introduction]**

The design also considered the rate at which injection and extraction would occur. AguaClara plant sand filters perform filtration by running water through and extracting from the sand bed at controlled rates. The respective injection and extraction rates were calculated based on backwash velocity and the respective design of the team's apparatus. This is calculated in the Python code in the [manual](#Manual) below. These rates were converted to RPM for the use of peristaltic pumps in ProCoDa, marked as inject and extract. The values for the first trial were as follows:
| Injection Flow Rate     | Extraction Flow Rate
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| 36.67 mL/s | 18.36 mL/s      |

**[What is injection flow? What is extraction flow? Is it just inlet and outlet?]**

In the first trial, the team allowed the injection flow (inlet) to fill the tube to the top before the extraction pump (outlet) was turned on. The extraction pump pulled water until the prototype was halfway drained and then the extraction pump would turn off again. At this point, gravity made injection from the top of the apparatus unnecessary and acted as an "injection" source.

The last design consideration was converting between mL/s and RPM on the peristaltic pump that was connected to the inlet and outlet tubing. The team made new set points that converted to RPM values for the pump using ProCoDa, the outlet and inlet flow in mL/s and the tubing sizes (16 for outlet and 18 for inlet). More is detailed about the set points below in the [manual](#Manual). This was a design consideration for the team because the tubing size was adjusted in the apparatus based on the capacity of the peristaltic pump rates and calculations in ProCoDa.

**[Why was this a design consideration? Which unit is more desirable?]**

#### Trial 2
In the design of the second experimental apparatus, the team reconsidered the flow rates of injection and extraction pumps. Understanding more about the application of the prototype to real Aguaclara Filters, the team calculated the following:

**[How did trial 2 resemble real AguaClara Filters more than trial 1?]**

| Injection Flow Rate | Extraction Flow Rate |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| 220.02 mL/s         | 36.67 mL/s           |

After trial 1, the team came to understand that the 6 layers of sand filter would be extracting at the same rate. Therefore, the injection flow rate that the team had used previously was not sufficiently large.

Again, more information about these number can be found in the Python code below in the [manual](#Manual).

The team used the same method of filling the prototype to the top before draining and turning off the extraction before the water level reached below the extraction tubes.

#### Trial 3
After considering the second trial, the team again revisited the flow rates. The team had not considered that the flow rate through the filter would be divided by the 3 outlet holes, leading to some error. Therefore, instead of extracting 36.67 mL/s from all three extraction tubes, each would be attached to a pump extracting at 36.67 mL/s. The Python code for the third trial in the [manual](#Manual) explains how the new flow rate was calculated.

| Injection Flow Rate | Extraction Flow Rate |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| 220.02 mL/s         | 36.67 mL/s           |

In anticipation of failure, the team first decided to measure whether only one filter outlet could extract at the flow rate. To do so, the team planned on stopping flow from the upper two holes and attaching one pump to the injection tube one pump to the extraction tube. Therefore, the apparatus was designed so that the team could monitor the extraction zone and escape of sand into the outlet more closely.
#### Trial 4
The fourth trial was the first trial with the extraction tubes removed from the apparatus. In actual AguaClara plants, the water is driven out of the filter by gravity, there are not electric pumps, which is the beauty of AguaClara technology. The team obtained a rubber cap and clamp for the top of the apparatus, thinking that the system would fill up and possibly overflow. It was discovered that this was not a concern because at steady-state, the water level does not rise above the level that the pressure from the atmosphere establishes. This pressure was an issue in this trial because water was only exiting from the bottom branch. If the holes were plugged in order to allow the whole apparatus to fill with water, the water would flow out from the three branches quickly until the water level was only above the last hole again. There was also a problem when the top was placed on during forward filtration that it pushed air into the reactor and forced sand out of the holes. No sand exited when the apparatus was left still and the exclusion zones were allowed to form.

#### Trial 5

As in the recent trial, the team added dry sand to the empty reactor and then filled the reactor with water. During trial 5 the same flow rate was used as that for trials three and four:

| Injection Flow Rate | Extraction Flow Rate |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| 220.02 mL/s         | 36.67 mL/s           |

Up to this point, the water successfully flowed from the outlets of the reactor without sand exiting, however the issue remained of air bubbles lodged between the branches of the reactor. The air bubble would move when different holes were blocked. The team hypothesized that this problem was caused by the pressure within the reactor caused by the lid that had been placed on top. In addition, the team presumed that when sand did exit, it was due to a pressure differential caused in that moment by blocking part of the exit. The team considered that in an AguaClara plant, the filter is open to the atmosphere, and as a result decided to remove the lid from the reactor, leaving the top open. The hope was that eliminating the lid would eliminated the air bubbles, which proved successful.

#### Trial 6
The main goal for the sixth trial was to generate a system in which the extraction holes and filter were all submerged under water. This task was difficult for the team because there were no longer extraction tubes and it could not simply be submerged in water because of the sand and the need to regulate how much water was coming out.

Creatively, the team thought of a small apparatus that would be added on to the current apparatus. It would be some kind of cup or box that would surround the extraction holes to be filled with water. Although it would be open at the top to the atmosphere for water to flow out, this technically would submerge the filter system with water.

<p align="center">

### Experimental Apparatus Fabrication
#### Trial 1
In the previous semester, the team glued extraction tubes to the apparatus to begin to test design feasibility. Upon revisiting the idea, the team decided the outlet pipe size did not match a minimum inner diameter value.

| Respective Flow Rate      | Minimum Tube Inner Diameter  
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| 36.67 milliliter / second | 3.762 millimeter      |

<p align="center">
Reference manual below for Python code calculations of these values. </p>

Glue had been used to connect the outlet "pipes" (tubing) to the reactor (the 4-inch diameter PVC pipe). To adjust the apparatus, after shaving the glue from the previous tubes, the team detached the tubes. **[Glue was never mentioned before. You should clarify when and where it was used.]** Using the new calculated inner diameter, the team found tubing that met the minimum standard and considered it's effect on **[it's effect on]** the design of the 3D printed "pine-tree" filter which already fit to the prototype PVC tube by **[drilled]** drilled holes. In the OnShape drawing, the team determined that if the filter was taken from the prototype, respective sized holes could be drilled with the drill press. The holes were designed to be offset from the original holes while still remaining in the bounds of the upper and lower wings. Holes were drilled to match these on the 4-Inch PVC prototype.

With three new outlet tubes of sufficient diameter glued water-tight, the team used two T-joint push-to-connect tubes to attach the outlet to a peristaltic pump of size 16 tubing. The inlet (lower cap) was tapped with push-to-connect that was attached to size 18 tubing in a peristaltic pump.

The team made the mistake of filling the apparatus with sand and then inverting so that exclusion zones could no longer form. The colored sand was chosen to closely monitor the escape of sand from the outlet tubes, but the color dyed the water and the method was unnecessary, leading to regular sand use in future trials.

<p align="center">
  Figure 5. The colored sand filling the exclusion zones as the apparatus was inverted.
</p>

**[Why was the sand colored?]**

#### Trial 2
In the second trial, the team drained the water and sand from the prototype. To better simulate plant conditions, Monroe suggested that the team first fill the prototype with water, and add sand from the top. This would create sand exclusion zones initially, that just needed to be maintained during water flow.

Also, to prevent sand from falling into the injection tube, the team added extremely porous metal mesh between the tube and the push-to-connect.

<p align="center"> <img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/StaRSFine/master/Images/Trial2Water.JPG" width= "350"> </p>
<p align="center">
  Figure 6. Water filling the apparatus before the addition of sand.
</p>

Using newly calculated flow rates from the experimental design passage above, the apparatus was set up the same way as in the first trial, with detail in respect to the order of addition of sand and water. This also prevented the sand from entering the injection tubing because there was a constant water stream that made use of gravity exclusion. When the sand nearly filled the tube, the upper lid was secured and the extraction began.

#### Trial 3
This purpose of this trial was to test the feasibility of the intense newly calculated flow rate. Therefore, the team honed in on one filter wing outlet hole to analyze. The team used plugs at the push-to-connects in lieu of pump tubing to stop the flow from the upper two tubes.

Other than the use of only one extraction hole, the test was conducted in the same way as the earlier trials where the apparatus was filled with water and sand before extraction. After beginning extraction, the injection flow would remain until the water level was close to the opening of the filter outlet hole. The injection and extraction tubes were attached to two peristaltic pumps, set to their effective flow rates in RPM.

<p align="center">

</p>

The apparatus was filled with water and then sand, then the cap was placed on while the water was still being pumped into the bottom. This initial pressure change of placing a cap on and forcing air into the apparatus and some sand out of the outlet. This suggested that this added pressure was an incorrect way of testing the filter.
#### Trial 5
As in the recent trial, the team added dry sand to the empty reactor and then filled the reactor with water. In contrast to previous trials, the team left the apparatus open to the atmosphere on top, leaving the lid off for the duration of experimentation.

#### Trial 6
To fabricate the cup shape that would generate the submerged system the team hoped, a 125 mL Nalgene sample bottle was cut in half to fit the side of the current apparatus and curved to generate a water-tight shape using the precision drill. The narrow top part of the bottle was also cut so that water could spill over the top. The team considered that the cup would have to cover all three of the outlet holes in choosing the use the bottle.

Using PVC-glue, the team secured the bottle half to the apparatus and tested for water-tightness before conducting experiments with it.

### Feasibility of Design and Analysis
Before running the experiments, the team ensured that the prototype was watertight in order to collect accurate data regarding the flow rates of injection and extraction.

#### Trial 1

The initial mistake of inverting the apparatus caused a limitation in the team's understanding of how the design would work in terms of water exclusion zone. The lower of the three triangular partitions was able to form the strongest exclusion zone, which was in fact pulling water without sand.

This trial gave the team an indication of how to move on, but it should be noted that flow rates were not yet indicative of the Aguaclara filtration flow rates (of injection and extraction).

<p align="center">
  Figure 9. The extraction tubes pulling water without sand from the lower exclusion zone. Note the top tube was pulling sand from the most failed exclusion zone and the middle was pulling air.
</p>

#### Trial 2

The biggest issue with the second trial was that only the top tube pulled water out. This can be explained by a couple of possibilities. There was water leaking through the middle and bottom tubes, suggesting that they were not watertight and so they may have been pulling air only. The existence of air bubbles within the filter was also indication that there is flaw in the design.

<p align="center"> <img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/StaRSFine/master/Images/Trial2Filter.JPG" width= "350"> </p>
<p align="center">
  Figure 10. The filter extraction zones during the second trial. Note the air bubbles in between the layers.
</p>

The top tube did not have any sand in it and the exclusion zones did exist, in a sense which is an essential insight moving forward. This means that at least one of the gravity exclusion zones formed and was capable of operating at the necessary velocity without failure. In agreement with the first trial, the lowest of the three "branches" was successfully pulling water.

<p align="center">
  Figure 11. The extraction tubes during the second trial.
</p>

#### Trial 3
In the third trial, the team discovered a very promising result for Aguaclara; the extraction pump could pull water out of one layer of the filter without sand in the output. The minimum failure velocity of the exclusion zones, although not yet found, should be greater than the maximum flow rate out of the filter in true Aguaclara plants.

Although this information is exciting for the team, this trial did not use all three exclusion zones that the original design intended. The optimized filter would pull water from all three of the outlet tubes.

<p align="center"> <img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/StaRSFine/master/Images/ExclusionZonesTrial3.PNG" width= "450"> </p>
<p align="center">
  Figure 12. The exclusion zones during the third trial.
</p>

The air bubbles existed in the upper two partitions that were plugged. The next move for the team would be to take steps to understand more about the pressure differential in the apparatus and determine a different way to extract from the filters, because the air bubble problem is not going away without reconsideration.

Another persistent issue is the availability of pumps that can function at a rate as high as the team needs. Also, in the AguaClara filters, it is not customary to have water deliberately pulled from filters, rather than just having it come out on its own at a rate determined by the rate of water going in.

#### Trial 4
This trial solved some problems from Trial 3. Only one pump is necessary to pump water in from the bottom, and the air bubble issue presented itself in a different way. This time, the water level fell to just above the bottom hole.   
#### Trial 5
The new apparatus set-up proved successful in dislodging the air bubbles that had previously caused concern. The set up for Trial 5 remained effective in preventing sand from exiting. The new set-up did cause a new concern - once the tank filled to a point above all outlets (with outlets blocked during filling), the water level would drop and exit solely through the bottom most outlet.

The team suspected that this exit issue was due again to pressure differential, which led to the idea of submerging the outlets, as will be discussed in trial 6.

#### Trial 6
Trial 6 was incredibly successful for the progress of this project. The submerged system worked seamlessly, and was the most authentic model of true Aguaclara sand filter systems thus far. The team conducted an initial test to see how the cup design would suffice, and, after proving its success, ran the trial at steady state for 30 minutes. This proved that the system could consistently pull water from the exclusion zones without sand also escaping.

## Conclusions

Testing the apparatus with sand and water running at filtration speeds made the flaws in the apparatus used for experimentation clear, and has shown that the "Christmas tree" design can handle very high filtration speeds without failure. The second trial showed that the top branch of the filter can handle high velocities of filtration without sand leaving in the outlet pipes, which is encouraging for predicting the success of this design. The third trial stands to show the strength of the exclusion zones that are formed by this design. The fourth, fifth, and sixth trials have been progressively better at simulating how actual AguaClara plants function. There have been many indications that this design will not fail even at forward filtration speeds that are much faster than predicted. Because of the pressure issues that the team has found with the apparatus failures, there have been many tests where all of the water comes out of one outlet branch. This is a problem in testing the whole design, but at the same time, it shows that each branch can handle a filtration speed three times faster than it needs to. This "safety factor" is encouraging as the team considers testing the branched design at Cornell's water treatment plant.

## Future Work
Based on the three trials completed so far this semester, the most pressing goal was to have an experiment where water was pulled from all three tubes. With consideration of plant limitations, the team could move forward to testing failure and finding the filtration velocity where sand begins to be pulled out with the water. If this velocity is reasonably high (i.e. much higher than any velocity expected in an AguaClara plant), the team will have a conversation about next steps necessary to implement the design in actual AguaClara plants. If the failure velocity is low or gravity exclusion zones don't form dependably, the team will need to try other designs. Variations of the design may include more or less branches, bigger spaces between branches, or potentially a new design entirely. The next trial would utilize the filter without extraction pumping, and hopefully begin to combat the issue with air and pressure differential.

**[As someone who is not familiar with this subteam I had a really hard time understanding what the terms were, and why certain things were done. I think you guys can do a much better job at fleshing out the report, specifically at the introduction and previous work so that people who aren't as well versed can follow along better. I know that expanding it may seem self-evident, even redundant, to you but everything is neat and organized in your head, having connections between certain subjects that the audience, such as me, may not have. Overall I liked the report. Where the writing lacked, the diagrams helped me get a general idea of what was going on, but the writing could definitely improve.]**

# Manual
## ProCoDa

The ProCoDa used thus far in the semester has been limited to making sure the input and output peristaltic pumps are running at the correct flow rates for their tube size. The team has not yet run an extended experiment regulated by ProCoDa. Using some of the pre-made Aguaclara packages, flow rate and fluid mechanic calculations are made easier for teams in lab.

For the peristaltic pump regulation calculations, the states were as follows.

### States

</p>

#### OFF
The off state was used while the experiments were not run. Because the team only used ProCoDa for calculations, rather than collecting data, these states were not used often.

#### Injection
The INJECT state used the set points *Just Water Flow* and *Water Tubing Size* to take into account the inlet flow rate in mL/s and the tubing size from inlet the peristaltic pump. As demonstrated above in figure ____, the *Just Water Pump* state outputs the value in revolutions per minute (RPM) divided by 100.

#### Extraction
The EXTRACT state used the set points *Outlet Flow* and *Outlet Tubing Size* to take into account the outlet flow rate in mL/s and the tubing size from the outlet peristaltic pump.*Outlet Pump*, used in the first three trials only, was setting the outlet flow rate for the peristaltic pump.
